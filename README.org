* helm-clojure
Emacs package based on [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][helm]] and [[https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider][cider]] for explore Clojure's project environment. With helm-clojure you can quickly discover ANY clojure vars (functions, protocols etc.) avaliable in JVM, read documentation, follow to definition, insert to current code by smart way.
** Installation
With [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] you can install helm-clojure by the following recipe:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (:name helm-clojure
         :type github
         :pkgname "prepor/helm-clojure"
         :features helm-clojure
         :depends (s dash cider helm yasnippet))
#+END_SRC
** References insertion
helm-clojure smart enough to insert references with regard the current namespace.
- if var or namespace in general already refered to namespace, it will be inserted without namespace;
- if namespace already required with alias, it will be inserted with the same alias;
- in other cases you will be suggested to choose alias with help of [[https://github.com/capitaomorte/yasnippet][yasnippet]] (TAB for complete)
